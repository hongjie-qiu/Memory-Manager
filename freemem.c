// Function Usage: 
// Return the block of storage at location p to the pool of available free storage. 

// The pointer value p must be one that was obtained as the result of a call to getmem. 
// If p is NULL, then the call to freemem has no effect and returns immediately. 
// If p has some value other than one returned by getmem, 
// or if the block it points to has previously been released by another call to freemem, then the operation of freemem is undefined

// When freemem returns a block of storage to the pool, 
// if the block is physically located in memory adjacent to one or more other free blocks, 
// then the free blocks involved should be combined into a single larger block, 
// rather than adding the small blocks to the free list individually.

// Parameter: p - location of the block to be freed
