// Function usage:
// Check for possible problems with the free list data structure and verify that the free list has the following properties:
// Blocks are ordered with strictly increasing memory addresses
// Block sizes are positive numbers and no smaller than the minimum size
// Blocks do not overlap
// Blocks are not touching
// Function returns silently if no error is detected
// If error is detected, assert should fail and cause the program to terminate at that point
